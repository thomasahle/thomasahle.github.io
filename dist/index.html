               <div class='abstract'>A Locality-Sensitive Hash (LSH) function is called (r,cr,p₁,p₂)-sensitive, if two data-points with a distance less than r collide with probability at least p₁ while data points with a distance greater than cr collide with probability at most p₂.
These functions form the basis of the successful Indyk-Motwani algorithm (STOC 1998) for nearest neighbour problems.
In particular one may build a c-approximate nearest neighbour data structure with query time O(n<sup>ρ</sup>/p₁) where ρ = (log 1/p₁)/(log 1/p₂) ∈ (0,1).
That is, <em>sub-linear time</em>, as long as p₁ is not too small.
This is significant since most high dimensional nearest neighbour problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and can't be solved <em>exact</em>, faster than a brute force <em>linear-time</em> scan of the database.

Unfortunately, the best LSH functions tend to have very low collision probabilities, p₁ and p₂.
Including the best functions for Cosine and Jaccard Similarity.
This means that the n<sup>ρ</sup>/p₁ query time of <em>LSH is often not sub-linear after all</em>, even for approximate nearest neighbours!

In this paper, we improve the general Indyk-Motwani algorithm to reduce the query time of LSH to O(n<sup>ρ</sup>/p₁<sup>1-ρ</sup>) (and the space usage correspondingly.)
Since  n<sup>ρ</sup>/p₁<sup>1-ρ</sup> < n ⇔ p₁ > 1/n,
our algorithm always obtains sublinear query time, for any collision probabilities at least  1/n.
For  p₁  and  p₂  small enough, our improvement over all previous methods can be <em>up to a factor  n </em> in both query time and space.

The improvement comes from a simple change to the Indyk-Motwani algorithm, which can easily be implemented in existing software packages.

               <div class='abstract'>We formulate and optimally solve a new generalized Set Similarity Search problem,
which assumes the size of the database and query sets are known in advance.
By creating polylog copies of our data-structure, we optimally solve any symmetric Approximate Set Similarity Search problem, including approximate versions of Subset Search, Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS), Jaccard Similarity Search and Partial Match.

Our algorithm can be seen as a natural generalization of previous work on Set as well as Euclidean Similarity Search, but conceptually it differs by optimally exploiting the information present in the sets as well as their complements, and doing so asymmetrically between queries and stored sets.
Doing so we improve upon the best previous work:
MinHash [J. Discrete Algorithms 1998], SimHash [STOC 2002], Spherical LSF
[SODA 2016, 2017] and Chosen Path [STOC 2017] by as much as a factor n^{.14} in both time and space; or in the near-constant time regime, in space, by an arbitrarily large polynomial factor.

Turning the geometric concept, based on Boolean supermajority functions, into a practical algorithm requires ideas from branching random walks on Z^2, for which we give the first non-asymptotic near tight analysis.

Our lower bounds follow from new hypercontractive arguments, which can be seen as characterizing the exact family of similarity search problems for which supermajorities are optimal.
The optimality holds for among all hashing based data structures in the random setting, and by reductions, for 1 cell and 2 cell probe data structures.
As a side effect, we obtain new hypercontractive bounds on the directed noise operator.

               <div class='abstract'>Kernel methods are fundamental tools in machine learning that allow detection of non-linear dependencies between data without explicitly constructing feature vectors in high dimensional spaces. A major disadvantage of kernel methods is their poor scalability: primitives such as kernel PCA or kernel ridge regression generally take prohibitively large quadratic space and (at least) quadratic time, as kernel matrices are usually dense. Some methods for speeding up kernel linear algebra are known, but they all invariably take time exponential in either the dimension of the input point set (e.g., fast multipole methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality) or in the degree of the kernel function.
Oblivious sketching has emerged as a powerful approach to speeding up numerical linear algebra over the past decade, but our understanding of oblivious sketching solutions for kernel matrices has remained quite limited, suffering from the aforementioned exponential dependence on input parameters. Our main contribution is a general method for applying sketching solutions developed in numerical linear algebra over the past decade to a tensoring of data points without forming the tensoring explicitly. This leads to the first oblivious sketch for the polynomial kernel with a target dimension that is only polynomially dependent on the degree of the kernel function, as well as the first oblivious sketch for the Gaussian kernel on bounded datasets that does not suffer from an exponential dependence on the dimensionality of input data points.

               <div class='abstract'>We show that approximate similarity (near neighbour) search can be solved in high dimensions with performance matching state of the art (data independent) Locality Sensitive Hashing, but with a guarantee of no false negatives.
Specifically we give two data structures for common problems.
For c-approximate near neighbour in Hamming space, for which we get query time dn^{1/c+o(1)} and space dn^{1+1/c+o(1)} matching that of [Indyk and Motwani, 1998] and answering a long standing open question from [Indyk, 2000a] and [Pagh, 2016] in the affirmative.
For $(s1,s2)$-approximate Jaccard similarity we get query time d^2n^{ρ+o(1)} and space d^2n^{1+ρ+o(1)}, ρ= [log (1+s1)/(2s1)]/[log (1+s2)/(2s2)], when sets have equal size, matching the performance of [Pagh and Christiani, 2017].

We use space partitions as in classic LSH, but construct these using a combination of brute force, tensoring and splitter functions à la [Naor et al., 1995].
We also show two dimensionality reduction lemmas with 1-sided error.

               <div class='abstract'>We present a data structure for <i>spherical range reporting</i> on a point set S, i.e., reporting all points in S that lie within radius r of a given query point q. Our solution builds upon the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) framework of Indyk and Motwani, which represents the asymptotically best solutions to near neighbor problems in high dimensions. While traditional LSH data structures have several parameters whose optimal values depend on the distance distribution from q to the points of S, our data structure is parameter-free, except for the space usage, which is configurable by the user. Nevertheless, its expected query time basically matches that of an LSH data structure whose parameters have been <i>optimally chosen for the data and query</i> in question under the given space constraints. In particular, our data structure provides a smooth trade-off between hard queries (typically addressed by standard LSH) and easy queries such as those where the number of points to report is a constant fraction of S, or where almost all points in S are far away from the query point. In contrast, known data structures fix LSH parameters based on certain parameters of the input alone.
<br/>The algorithm has expected query time bounded by O(t(n/t)^ρ), where t is the number of points to report and ρ∈(0,1) depends on the data distribution and the strength of the LSH family used. We further present a parameter-free way of using multi-probing, for LSH families that support it, and show that for many such families this approach allows us to get expected query time close to O(n^ρ+t), which is the best we can hope to achieve using LSH. The previously best running time in high dimensions was Ω(tn^ρ). For many data distributions where the intrinsic dimensionality of the point set close to q is low, we can give improved upper bounds on the expected query time.

               <div class='abstract'>A number of tasks in classification, information retrieval, recommendation systems, and record linkage reduce to the core problem of inner product similarity join (IPS join): identifying pairs of vectors in a collection that have a sufficiently large inner product. IPS join is well understood when vectors are normalized and some approximation of inner products is allowed. However, the general case where vectors may have any length appears much more challenging. Recently, new upper bounds based on asymmetric locality-sensitive hashing (ALSH) and asymmetric embeddings have emerged, but little has been known on the lower bound side. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of inner product similarity join, showing new lower and upper bounds. Our main results are: 
<br/>* Approximation hardness of IPS join in subquadratic time, assuming the strong exponential time hypothesis. 
<br/>* New upper and lower bounds for (A)LSH-based algorithms. In particular, we show that asymmetry can be avoided by relaxing the LSH definition to only consider the collision probability of distinct elements. 
<br/>* A new indexing method for IPS based on linear sketches, implying that our hardness results are not far from being tight. 
<br/>Our technical contributions include new asymmetric embeddings that may be of independent interest. At the conceptual level we strive to provide greater clarity, for example by distinguishing among signed and unsigned variants of IPS join and shedding new light on the effect of asymmetry.

               <div class='abstract'>We construct a structured Johnson Lindenstrauss transformation that can be applied to simple tensors on the form x = x^(1) ⊗ ... ⊗ x^(c) ∈ ℝ^(dᶜ)$ in time nearly c⋅d.
That is, exponentially faster than writing out the Kronecker product and then mapping down.

These matrices, M, which preserves the norm of any x ∈ ℝ^(d^c), such that | ||Mx||₂ - ||x||₂ | < ε with probability  1-δ , can be taken to have just  Õ(c² ε⁻² (log1/δ)³)  rows.
This is within c² (\log1/δ)²  of optimal for any JL matrix [Larsen & Nelson], and improves upon earlier 'Tensor Sketch' constructions by Pagh and Pham, which used  Õ(3ᶜ ε⁻² δ⁻¹)  rows, by an exponential amount in both  c  and  δ⁻² .

It was shown by Avron, Nguyen and Woodruff that Tensor Sketch is a subspace embedding.
This has a large number of applications, such as guaranteeing the correctness of kernel-linear regression performed directly on the reduced vectors.
We show that our construction is a subspace embedding too, improving again upon the exponential dependency on  c  and  δ⁻¹ , enabling sketching of much higher order polynomial kernels, such as Taylor approximations to the ubiquitous Gaussian radial basis function.

Technically, we construct our matrix  M  such that  M(x ⊗ y) = Tx ∘ T'y  where  ∘  is the Hadamard (element-wise) product and  T  and  T'  support fast matrix-vector multiplication ala [Ailon Chazelle].
To analyze the behavior of  Mx  on non-simple  x , we show a higher order version of Khintchine's inequality, related to the higher order Gaussian chaos analysis by Latała.
Finally we show that such sketches can be combined recursively, in a way that doesn't increase the dependency on  c  by much.

               <div class='abstract'>We consider efficient combinatorial constructions, that allow us to partly derandomize data-structures using the locality sensitive framework of Indyk and Motwani (FOCS '98).
In particular our constructions allow us to make Zero-Error Probabilistic Polynomial Time (ZPP) analogues of two state of the art algorithms for `Approximate Set Similarity':

This data-structure problem deals with storing a collection  X  of sets such that given a query set  q  for which there exists  x ∈ P  with  |q ∩ x|/|q ∪ x| >= s_1 , the data structures return  x'∈ P  with  |q ∩ x'|/|q ∪ x'|\ge s_2 .
The first algorithm by Broder et al.introduced the famous `minhash' function, which in the locality sensitive framework yields an  n^{ρ_b}  time,  n^{1+ρ_b}  space data structure for  ρ_b=(log1/s_1)/(log1/s_2) .
The second by Christiani et al.~ gives an  n^{ρ_c}  time  n^{1+ρ_c}  space data-structure for  ρ_c=(\log2s_1/(1+s_1))/(\log2s_2/(1+s_2)) .

Both algorithms use Monte Carlo randomization, but we show that this is not necessary, at least up to  n^{o(1)}  factors.
This settles an open problem from Arasu et al and Pagh asking whether locality sensitive data-structures could be made _exact_ or _without false negatives_ other than for hamming distance, and whether a performance gap was needed in the exponent.

The main approach in the thesis is to replace the `locality sensitive hash functions' or `space partitions' with `combinatorial design'.
We show that many such designs can be constructed efficiently with the `multi-splitters' introduced by Alon et al.
We further show that careful constructions of such designs can be efficiently decoded.

We also investigate upper and lower bounds on combinatorial analogues of the minhash algorithm.
This is related to the existence of small, approximate minwise hashing families under  l_∞  distance.

               <div class='abstract'>In the field of Computer Science, the Chernoff bound is an extremely useful found bounding the error probabilities of various algorithms. Chernoff gives an exponentially decaying upper bound on the probability that a sum of independent random variables is many standard deviations away from its expectation.
However sometimes we need more than an upper bound, and we need bounds that are tight within a constant factor or better. (There is a fairly standard tail lower bound, but it deviates
 from Chernoff by a factor of $\sqrt n$.)
In this project I will explore and derive multiple upper and lower bounds for Chernoff using methods ranging from geometric series and generating functions to saddlepoint approximations and laplace approximation. All these results will be known, but they don’t seem have a good exposition in Computer Science.
The reason also to consider more simple methods is to help an intuition for deriving similar bounds for different problems. In particular I will derive a tight bound for the size of the intersection between two hamming balls, which does not seem to exist in the literature.
I will use the formulas to answer whether algorithms exists for the following problems: Locality Sensitive Filters in hamming space with limited use of random bits (as opposed to current methods, requiring gaussian samples), LSF with improved performance for low dimensional spaces. (dimension < 2 log n) Linear space bit sampling LSH, which I have previously partially analyzed, but only in a different context, in which a full analysis was not necessary.
