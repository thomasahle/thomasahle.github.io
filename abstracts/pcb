Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have highlighted the need for novel
computing hardware in order to truly unlock the potential for AI. Physics-based hardware, such
as thermodynamic computing, has the potential to provide a fast, low-power means to accelerate
AI primitives, especially generative AI and probabilistic AI. In this work, we present a small-scale
thermodynamic computer, which we call the stochastic processing unit. This device is composed of
RLC circuits, as unit cells, on a printed circuit board, with 8 unit cells that are all-to-all coupled
via switched capacitances. It can be used for either sampling or linear algebra primitives, and we
demonstrate Gaussian sampling and matrix inversion on our hardware. The latter represents the
first thermodynamic linear algebra experiment. We envision that this hardware, when scaled up in
size, will have significant impact on accelerating various probabilistic AI applications.
