We show that approximate similarity search (near neighbour) can be solved in high dimensions with performance matching that of state of the art Locality Sensitive Hashing, but without false negatives. 

In particular we give two data structures for common problems. 
For c-approximate near neighbour in Hamming space, for which we get query time dn^{1/c+o(1)} and space dn^{1+1/c+o(1)} matching that of [Indyk and Motwani, 1998] and answering a long standing open question from [Indyk, 2000a] and [Pagh, 2016] in the affirmative. 
For (s_1,s_2)-approximate Jaccard similarity we get query time d^2n^{ρ+o(1)} and space d^2n^{1+ρ+o(1)}, ρ= [log (1+s1)/(2s1)]/[log (1+s2)/(2s2)], when sets have equal norm, matching the performance of [Pagh and Lybecker Christiani, 2017] and beating the classic `minhash' algorithm. 

Alternatively the data structures can be viewed as efficient constructions of large combinatorial designs with fast decoding algorithms. In particular Turán Systems and a type of codes with the guarantee that any two close points have a common neighbour in the code. This is the first polynomial time construction of large Turán Systems with guarantees matching that of the probabilistic method.
