About me:
I consistently publish in the highest tier conferences in Algorithms and Theoretical Computer Science research. My work answers questions raised by others and studied for decades, as well as it opens new avenues of research. My papers regularly introduce completely new mathematical techniques into the field, thus educating the community as well as solving problems.

Most knowledgeable person about LSH.
