In the field of Computer Science, the Chernoff bound is an extremely useful found bounding the error probabilities of various algorithms. Chernoff gives an exponentially decaying upper bound on the probability that a sum of independent random variables is many standard deviations away from its expectation.
However sometimes we need more than an upper bound, and we need bounds that are tight within a constant factor or better. (There is a fairly standard tail lower bound, but it deviates
 from Chernoff by a factor of $\sqrt n$.)
In this project I will explore and derive multiple upper and lower bounds for Chernoff using methods ranging from geometric series and generating functions to saddlepoint approximations and laplace approximation. All these results will be known, but they donâ€™t seem have a good exposition in Computer Science.
The reason also to consider more simple methods is to help an intuition for deriving similar bounds for different problems. In particular I will derive a tight bound for the size of the intersection between two hamming balls, which does not seem to exist in the literature.
I will use the formulas to answer whether algorithms exists for the following problems: Locality Sensitive Filters in hamming space with limited use of random bits (as opposed to current methods, requiring gaussian samples), LSF with improved performance for low dimensional spaces. (dimension < 2 log n) Linear space bit sampling LSH, which I have previously partially analyzed, but only in a different context, in which a full analysis was not necessary.
