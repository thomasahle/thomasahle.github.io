We consider efficient combinatorial constructions, that allow us to partly derandomize data-structures using the locality sensitive framework of Indyk and Motwani (FOCS '98).
In particular our constructions allow us to make Zero-Error Probabilistic Polynomial Time (ZPP) analogues of two state of the art algorithms for `Approximate Set Similarity':

This data-structure problem deals with storing a collection  X  of sets such that given a query set  q  for which there exists  x ∈ P  with  |q ∩ x|/|q ∪ x| >= s_1 , the data structures return  x'∈ P  with  |q ∩ x'|/|q ∪ x'|\ge s_2 .
The first algorithm by Broder et al.introduced the famous `minhash' function, which in the locality sensitive framework yields an  n^{ρ_b}  time,  n^{1+ρ_b}  space data structure for  ρ_b=(log1/s_1)/(log1/s_2) .
The second by Christiani et al.~ gives an  n^{ρ_c}  time  n^{1+ρ_c}  space data-structure for  ρ_c=(\log2s_1/(1+s_1))/(\log2s_2/(1+s_2)) .

Both algorithms use Monte Carlo randomization, but we show that this is not necessary, at least up to  n^{o(1)}  factors.
This settles an open problem from Arasu et al and Pagh asking whether locality sensitive data-structures could be made _exact_ or _without false negatives_ other than for hamming distance, and whether a performance gap was needed in the exponent.

The main approach in the thesis is to replace the `locality sensitive hash functions' or `space partitions' with `combinatorial design'.
We show that many such designs can be constructed efficiently with the `multi-splitters' introduced by Alon et al.
We further show that careful constructions of such designs can be efficiently decoded.

We also investigate upper and lower bounds on combinatorial analogues of the minhash algorithm.
This is related to the existence of small, approximate minwise hashing families under  l_∞  distance.
