<p>A Locality-Sensitive Hash (LSH) function is called (r,cr,p<sub>1</sub>,p<sub>1</sub>)-sensitive, if two data-points with a distance less than r collide with probability at least p<sub>1</sub> while data points with a distance greater than cr collide with probability at most p<sub>2</sub>.
These functions form the basis of the successful Indyk-Motwani algorithm (STOC 1998) for nearest neighbour problems.
In particular one may build a c-approximate nearest neighbour data structure with query time O(n<sup>ρ</sup>/p₁) where ρ = (log 1/p<sub>1</sub>)/(log 1/p<sub>2</sub>) ∈ (0,1).
That is, <em>sub-linear time</em>, as long as p<sub>1</sub> is not too small.
This is significant since most high dimensional nearest neighbour problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and can't be solved <em>exact</em>, faster than a brute force <em>linear-time</em> scan of the database.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the best LSH functions tend to have very low collision probabilities, p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub>.
Including the best functions for Cosine and Jaccard Similarity.
This means that the n<sup>ρ</sup>/p<sub>1</sub> query time of <em>LSH is often not sub-linear after all</em>, even for approximate nearest neighbours!
</p><p>
In this paper, we improve the general Indyk-Motwani algorithm to reduce the query time of LSH to O(n<sup>ρ</sup>/p<sub>1</sub><sup>1-ρ</sup>) (and the space usage correspondingly.)
Since  n<sup>ρ</sup>/p<sub>1</sub><sup>1-ρ</sup> < n ⇔ p<sub>1</sub> > 1/n,
our algorithm always obtains sublinear query time, for all collision probabilities at least  1/n.
For  p<sub>1</sub>  and  p<sub>2</sub>  small enough, our improvement over all previous methods can be <em>up to a factor  n </em> in both query time and space.
</p><p>
The improvement comes from a simple change to the Indyk-Motwani algorithm, which can easily be implemented in existing software packages.
