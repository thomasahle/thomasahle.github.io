<p>We prove the inequality
E(X/μ)ᵏ    ≤    [(k/μ)/log(k/μ+1)]ᵏ    ≤    exp[k²/(2μ)] for sub−poissonian random variables, such as Binomially or Poisson distributed random variables with mean μ.</p>
<p>This improves over previous uniform bounds for the raw moments of those distributions by a factor exponential in k.</p>
