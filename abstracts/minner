<p>Quantization is the state of the art approach to efficiently storing and searching large high-dimensional datasets. Broderâ€™97 introduced the idea of Minwise Hashing (MinHash) for quantizing or sketching large sets or binary strings into a small number of values and provided a way to reconstruct the overlap or Jaccard Similarity between two sets sketched this way.
</p><p>In this paper, we propose a new estimator for MinHash in the case where the database is quantized, but the query is not. By computing the similarity between a set and a MinHash sketch directly, rather than first also sketching the query, we increase precision and improve recall.
</p><p>We take a principled approach based on maximum likelihood with strong theoretical guarantees. Experimenal results show an improved recall@10 corresponding to 10-30% extra MinHash values. Finally, we suggest a third very simple estimator, which is as fast as the classical MinHash estimator while often more precise than the MLE.
</p><p>Our methods concern only the query side of search and can be used with any existing MinHashed database without changes to the data.t
